          Our class provides an opportunity to get acquainted, ask questions,
          and learn more about our church, our Presbyterian heritage, and our
          mission. We receive new members by profession of faith upon baptism,
          reaffirmation of faith, or letter of transfer from another church.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer membership classes twice a year - once in the fall and once
          in the spring. If you are interested in becoming a member, please call
          the Church Office at 626/282-4181.
